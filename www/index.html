            Do not go gentle into that good night,<BR>
            Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<BR>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<BR>
            <BR>
            Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <BR>
            Because their words had forked no lightning they <BR>
            Do not go gentle into that good night. <BR>
            <BR>
            Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <BR>
            Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <BR>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <BR>
            <BR>
            Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <BR>
            And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <BR>
            Do not go gentle into that good night. <BR>
            <BR>
            Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <BR>
            Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <BR>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <BR>
            <BR>
            And you, my father, there on the sad height, <BR>
            Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. <BR>
            Do not go gentle into that good night. <BR>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <BR>
